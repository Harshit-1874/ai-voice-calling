# Transcription System Implementation

## Overview

The new transcription system provides comprehensive call transcription functionality with database persistence, confidence scoring, and context retrieval for improved call quality.

## Key Features

### 1. Database Persistence
- All transcriptions are automatically saved to the database when calls end
- Uses batch insertion for better performance
- Only final transcriptions are saved (partial transcriptions are filtered out)

### 2. Confidence Scoring
- Tracks confidence scores for each transcription entry
- Provides detailed confidence statistics:
  - Average confidence
  - Min/Max confidence
  - Confidence by speaker (user vs assistant)
  - Total transcription count

### 3. Previous Call Context
- Retrieves context from previous calls to the same phone number
- Uses this context to provide more personalized conversations
- Configurable limit for number of previous calls to include

### 4. Real-time Processing
- Processes OpenAI WebSocket messages in real-time
- Handles both user and assistant transcriptions
- Supports partial and final transcriptions

## Database Schema

The transcription system uses the following database tables:

### CallLog
- Stores call metadata (SID, phone numbers, status, duration)
- Links to transcriptions and sessions

### Transcription
- Stores individual transcription entries
- Includes speaker, text, confidence, timestamp
- Links to call log via callLogId

### Session
- Tracks AI session information
- Links to call logs for session management

## API Endpoints

### Transcription Management
- `GET /transcriptions` - Get all transcriptions
- `GET /transcriptions/{call_sid}` - Get specific call transcription
- `GET /transcriptions/{call_sid}/text` - Get transcription as text
- `GET /transcriptions/{call_sid}/json` - Export transcription as JSON
- `GET /transcriptions/{call_sid}/summary` - Get transcription summary
- `DELETE /transcriptions/{call_sid}` - Delete transcription

### Context and Confidence
- `GET /call-context/{phone_number}` - Get previous call context
- `GET /call-confidence/{call_sid}` - Get confidence scores

### Call Details
- `GET /call-logs/{call_sid}` - Get detailed call info with transcriptions

## Usage Examples

### Starting a Call with Context
```python
# The system automatically retrieves previous call context
# and includes it in the initial greeting
await websocket_service.initialize_session(openai_ws, call_sid, to_number)
```

### Getting Confidence Scores
```python
confidence_scores = await transcription_service.get_call_confidence_score(call_sid)
print(f"Average confidence: {confidence_scores['average_confidence']}")
```

### Retrieving Previous Context
```python
context = await transcription_service.get_previous_call_context(phone_number, limit=3)
if context:
    print("Previous conversation context found")
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key for transcription

### System Message
The system uses a predefined message for Teya UK sales calls, but can be customized for different use cases.

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
cd backend
python test_transcription.py
```

## Integration Points

### WebSocket Service
- Handles real-time transcription processing
- Manages transcription buffers
- Saves transcriptions to database when calls end

### Call Controller
- Provides API endpoints for transcription management
- Includes confidence scoring in call details
- Supports context retrieval

### Prisma Service
- Database operations for transcriptions
- Call log management
- Session tracking

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Database connection failures
- Transcription processing errors
- Missing call logs
- Invalid confidence scores

## Performance Considerations

- Uses batch insertion for transcriptions
- Filters out partial transcriptions before saving
- Implements connection pooling for database operations
- Caches active transcriptions in memory

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Keyword extraction
   - Call quality scoring

2. **Machine Learning**
   - Predictive call outcomes
   - Automated follow-up suggestions
   - Conversation pattern recognition

3. **Integration Features**
   - CRM system integration
   - Email notification system
   - Dashboard analytics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Transcriptions not saving**
   - Check database connection
   - Verify call log exists
   - Check Prisma service initialization

2. **Low confidence scores**
   - Check audio quality
   - Verify OpenAI API key
   - Review transcription model settings

3. **Missing context**
   - Verify phone number format
   - Check previous call logs exist
   - Review context retrieval logic

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:
```python
logging.getLogger('services.transcription_service').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Security Considerations

- All transcriptions are stored securely in the database
- API endpoints include proper authentication
- Sensitive data is not logged
- Database connections use secure protocols
